However, RAG fails on global questions\\ndirected at an entire text corpus, such as “What are the main themes in the dataset?”, since\\nthis is inherently a query- focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval\\ntask. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, fail to scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical\\nRAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose a Graph\\nRAG approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the\\ngenerality of user questions and the quantity of source text to be in- dexed. Our approach\\nuses an LLM to build a graph-based text index in two stages: first to derive an entity\\nknowledge graph from the source documents, then to pre- generate community summaries\\nfor all groups of closely-related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used\\nto generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final\\nresponse to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1\\nmillion token range, we show that Graph RAG leads to substantial improvements over a na\\n̈ıve RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers. An\\nopen-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches\\nis forthcoming at https://aka.ms/graphrag.\\n######################\\nOutput:'"
